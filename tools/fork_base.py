"""Record this fork's upstream base, and check that its pinned submodules agree with it.

The SAME file is meant to be dropped unchanged into every FAR.AI fork that carries patches on an
upstream — it is not specific to any one repository. A repo may be a dependency, a consumer of
dependencies, or both, and each role is a mode of the same computation.

A fork commit `D` of project P is compatible with a commit `N` of a project that pins P when:

    compatible(N, D)  <=>  base(D) == pin_P(base(N))
    base(X)           =    merge-base(X, upstream/<branch>)
    pin_P(commit)     =    git ls-tree <commit> <path of P>   (in P's UPSTREAM consumer)

`base` is computable from git, but only in a full clone with the upstream remote fetched.
Consumers commonly declare submodules `shallow = true`, so the dependency usually cannot be asked
— hence each fork records its own base in `.fork-base.json`, and `--check` re-derives it so the
record cannot drift silently.

`--check` enforces four COMPATIBILITY rules:

  1. `.fork-base.json` still matches `merge-base(HEAD, upstream/<branch>)`.
  2. Every pinned submodule is compatible: a patched dependency's recorded base equals the commit
     upstream pins for it at our base; an unpatched one's gitlink equals upstream's exactly.
  3. A dependency's manifest describes the fork we actually pin (`fork_repo`) and the upstream we
     actually expect (`upstream_repo`). Two forks can share an upstream base while carrying
     entirely different patch sets, so the base alone does not identify a fork.
  4. A dependency's own nested submodules pin the same commits we do, matched by URL rather than
     path (layouts differ between repos). The base rule alone cannot catch this: a patch may move
     a nested gitlink without moving the dependency's base.

Repos with no submodules simply have nothing to do for 2-4.

It also enforces the SHAPE of history, which the compatibility rules assume but cannot see:

  5. Our history and upstream's meet at exactly one commit. Several meeting points would make
     `git merge-base` return an arbitrary one, so `upstream_base` would stop being reproducible.
  6. With `--against <ref>`, the base only ever moves forward. This needs both sides, so it is a
     PR-level check. If the target ref carries no manifest yet — the bootstrap case, where this
     very PR introduces it — that is reported as a note and does not fail.
  7. The root manifest names the checkout's actual origin, and a PR cannot silently change its
     fork/upstream repository or upstream branch identity relative to the target branch.

Merges from upstream are how the base advances: force-pushing is banned, so `git merge
upstream/<branch>` is the sync mechanism. It rewrites nothing — upstream's commits keep their SHAs
and simply become reachable, so merge-base moves forward on its own.

The manifest deliberately records only fields that are stable across the patch series. Recording
the fork head or the patch SHAs would force a regeneration on every commit, and could never be
accurate inside the very commit that carries them.

Usage:
    tools/fork_base.py --write        # regenerate .fork-base.json from git
    tools/fork_base.py --check        # verify the manifest AND the pins
    tools/fork_base.py --check --json # machine-readable report
    tools/fork_base.py --print        # emit the computed base, for scripts
    tools/fork_base.py --check --against origin/farai/main   # PR: base must move forward
